h1. Shell.fm interface on a Pertelian X2040 LCD display

This is an LCD interface for shell.fm. It is designed to be used with a keyboard, and
allows a user to control the shell.fm radio stream.

It uses threads to manage scrolling and to fake a count-down of the remaining time
between shell.fm refreshes. It updates the display with any changes every 0.1 seconds.

In the future, it will also show a clock when the track is paused, show weather info,
poll an RSS feed for news, etc.

h3. Requirements:

* Ruby
* shell.fm running with the network service enabled
* Pertelian X2040 LCD display
